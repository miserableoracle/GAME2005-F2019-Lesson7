# GAME3001 - S2019 - Lesson 6 - Repo for Pathfinding

### Update
The project simulates a particle in uniform projectile motion.

### Problem Description

Over a completely flat surface a thermal detonator (Star Wars) is thrown by a wookiee (a member of the rebel alliance) towards a group of imperial stormtroopers. The thermal detonator always leaves the wookieeâ€™s hand with a speed of 100m/s and the thermal detonator has a mass of 3.2kg.

a) Suppose that the Stormtroopers are 500m away. What is the correct angle for the wookiee to throw the thermal detonator so that it reaches the Stormtroopers.
b) What is the maximum distance the thermal detonator could travel? 
c) If we know that there is an average wind force of 0.4N in the positive horizontal direction then redo the above calculations taking into account this added force.
